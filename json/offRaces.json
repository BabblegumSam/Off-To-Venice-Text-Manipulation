He doesn't mind I have a LA crass way about me. He loves me, with every beat of his cocaine heart. Swimmin' pool glimmerin', darling. White bikini off with my red nail polish. Watch me in the swimmin' pool, bright blue ripples. You sittin', sippin' on your Black Cristal, oh, yeah. Light of my life, fire of my loins Be a good baby, do what I want. Light of my life, fire of my loins. Gimme them gold coins, gimme them coins. And I'm off to the races, cases of Bacardi chasers. Chasin' me all over town. 'Cause he knows I'm wasted, facin' time again at Rikers Island. And I won't get out. Because I'm crazy, baby. I need you to come here and save me. I'm your little scarlet, starlet, singin' in the garden. Kiss me on my open mouth. Ready for you."
