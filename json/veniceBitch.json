Oh God, miss you on my lips. It's me your little Venice bitch. On the stoop with the neighborhood kids. Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss. You're in the yard, I light the fire. And as the summer fades away. Nothing gold can stay. You write, I tour, we make it work. You're beautiful and I'm insane. We're American-made. Give me Hallmark. One dream, one life, one lover. Paint me happy in blue. Norman Rockwell, no hype under our covers. It's just me and you. Oh God, miss you on my lips. It's me your little Venice bitch. On the stoop with the neighborhood kids. Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss."
